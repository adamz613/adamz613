- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @adamz613
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ... Crypto and NFTS (Eth, erc 20, erc721, ect) STARTED ABOUT A MONTH AGO and I'm always very good at self-taught things and
 mathematics however this is something that you can't really self teach you need experience people to kind of nudge you along the way. I have no experience with coding but I'm very good with electronics and problem solving skills
I want to the first four weeks of crypto. Week 1 deposited like $500 in East room and made like a hundred bucks in a week just from the growth and so naturally I thought I had it all figured out.
Week 2 was when my discord had 150 servers in it and I literally would be on my phone or laptop 20 hours a day grinding for a whitelist in a project I know nothing about also got scanned once for two nfts and 100$. Week 3
Began to learn that there's actually things called road maps and long-term goals of these servers and mitting these specific nfts not just to get as many as you can catch them all like Pokemon LOL so I started clearing out my discord closet
Week 4 I have about 1500 Eth 5 nfts a WL in a good server with a good leader good admins and a good contract that I'm going to admit in and was added to a server today that I've been trying to get into for a month now because it's a closed server apparently doing something right on Twitter because
Certain people are following me were liking my comments retreating them vice versa and they're like that Elon musk's of crypto but I have no idea besides champ who else is top dogs. I also invested in a cold wallet on Amazon for $150 it's called elllipal it's basically a for 5 year old phone that runs on Android and comes with an accompanying app on your phone
That you download and have to scan QR codes to physically move any money from the device itself which has like a screen about 5 in it's not a ledger that's just like a flash drive it's more like a mini cheap old phone that's just a cold while so if my seed phrase somehow gets compromised again it doesn't matter because they would also have to have the physical cold waller to scan the QR app before they could move any assets
Now week five I'm stuck on the part where I have $800 in my cold wallet I have five nfts in my cold wallet but that's only because it's linked to my metamask which is my main wallet profileWell and also have around 500 in coinbase and couple hundred and crypto.com and a little more spread between a few crypto.com defi wallets and coinbase I managed to transfer all of the five nfds I had left out of my compromise metamask to a new phone that 
I just got with a new metamask account the problem is just finding all of my assets eths wise and consolidating them to my metamask that's backed by my cold wallet now you're all caught up that's where I am now.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ... crypto and NFTS Eth hopefully coding to
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on .. a tutorship not so much a collaboration I just want to be as informed as possible and learn from the people that actually know what exactly they're doing and talking about with that getting scammed on discord. like a mentor
- üì´ How to reach me ... adamz613@gmail.com, adamz6131992@gmail.com, @sender4lyfe Twitter , letsgobrandon_13 #1313 dischord and 10thdegreesendbelt on IG
. Or just Brandon Adams on FB would really appreciate the help and it would mean a lot to somebody that's in a very tight spot where if this doesn't work out that's the rest of my savings.
